# Elixpy: Elixir for Python

Elixpy is an implementation of [Elixir's](elixir-lang.org) standard library. Elixir is a functional, concurrent programming language. However, I find that Python has a better ecosystem. I tried to merge the best of both worlds by writing elixpy. Note that all of these functions may not be optimal or fast and that you use it at your own risk. I have also written my own functions; that is, not all functions in Elixpy are from Elixir. 

## Installation

Elixpy is available on PyPI: `pip install elixpy` should install it. If, for some reason, you wish to install it from source, the source is available at this [gist](https://gist.github.com/techieji/539c62d1409af3a43ed2a2251cffc3b0). This version may be unstable. Once you install it, I recommend, for now, that you import it like so: `from elixpy install func`, the reason being the only module in elixpy is func. I will be adding more modules later.
